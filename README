Project Overview:
The "Decentralized Social Network" is a Web3-based platform that aims to provide users with a decentralized and censorship-resistant social networking experience. It leverages blockchain technology and decentralized storage to empower users with control over their data, privacy, and the ability to interact directly with others without relying on centralized platforms.

Key Features:

User Profiles and Identity: Users can create profiles with customizable information and manage their digital identities securely using decentralized identity protocols.
Content Sharing: Users can share various types of content such as text posts, images, videos, and links with their connections or the wider network.
Privacy and Data Ownership: Users have full control over their data and can decide how it is shared, ensuring privacy and preventing unauthorized access.
Interactions and Connections: Users can connect with others, follow or be followed, and engage in public or private conversations through messaging or comments.
Community Governance: Implement decentralized governance mechanisms where users have a say in platform rules, content moderation, and decision-making.
Tokenized Incentives: Introduce a native token to incentivize and reward users for quality content, curation, and active participation within the network.
Decentralized Storage: Utilize decentralized storage systems to store and distribute user-generated content, enhancing data security and availability.
Censorship Resistance: Enable resistance against censorship by leveraging blockchain technology, ensuring that content remains accessible and uncensored.
Installation and Usage:

Users register and create an account, which generates a unique cryptographic key pair for identity management.
Customize profile information and privacy settings, determining the level of information shared with the network.
Share content such as posts, media, and links, allowing for public or private visibility and engagement options.
Connect with other users, follow their activities, and engage in discussions through comments or private messages.
Participate in community governance by voting on platform proposals or suggesting improvements.
Earn platform tokens through active participation, quality content creation, and community engagement.
Access content securely through decentralized storage, ensuring data ownership and control.
